**Aquarium Object Detection using Faster R-CNN**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the application of the Fast R-CNN algorithm for object detection on the Aquarium Dataset. The dataset consists of 7 classes of aquatic animals typically seen in aquariums. The project trains and evaluates a Fast R-CNN model to detect these classes with high precision and recall.

**Dataset**

The Aquarium Dataset is sourced from Roboflow and contains the following classes:

Fish

Stingray

Jellyfish

Penguin

Shark

Puffin

Starfish

This dataset is a toy dataset suitable for learning and experimenting with object detection tasks.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Programming language.

Faster R-CNN: Deep learning architecture for object detection.

PyTorch: Framework for building and training the model.

torchvision: For pretrained models and dataset transformations.

Matplotlib: For visualizing detection results.
